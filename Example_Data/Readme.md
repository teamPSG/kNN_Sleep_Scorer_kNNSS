# Repository for Example Dataset

This folder has two subfolders:

- IntermRes, which is initially empty, is the folder that will store results of intermediate calculations, like the feature table file (features & manual scores), the partitioned training and test sets, as well as the trained classifiers.

- RawData: this folder stores an example dataset to present software capabilities. The data was kindly provided by Stephen Morairty and Thomas Kilduff (Center for Neuroscience SRI International). A subfolder called EDF stores electrophysiological recording from wild type mice in the [European Data Format](https://www.edfplus.info), while the associated FFT folder stores manual scores to each 10-second long time bin of the recordings.
