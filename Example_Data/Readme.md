# Repository for Example Dataset

This folder has two subfolders:

- RawData: This folder stores a dataset to allow the user to assess software capabilities. These data have been published previously in [Frontiers in Pharmacology](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2018.00035).  The EDF subfolder contains electrophysiological recordings from Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) knockout mice in the [European Data Format](https://www.edfplus.info), while the associated FFT folder presents the corresponding state designations assigned to each 10-sec recording epoch.

- IntermRes, which is initially empty, is the folder that will store results of intermediate calculations, like the feature table file (features & manual scores), the partitioned training and test sets, as well as the trained classifiers.
