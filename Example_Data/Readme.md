# Repository for Example Dataset

This folder has two subfolders:

- RawData: This folder stores the abridged version of two datasets allowing the user to assess software capabilities: One from male Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 (TAAR1) knockout mice (file names starting with 'tko') described in detail in [Schwartz *et al*. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2018.00035), and the other from male Sprague-Dawley rats (file names starting with 'A') collected in the Sleep Neurobiology Laboratory at [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/). The EDF subfolder contains electrophysiological recordings in the [European Data Format](https://www.edfplus.info), while the associated FFT folder presents the corresponding state designations assigned to each 10-sec recording epoch.

- IntermRes, which is initially empty, is the folder that will store results of intermediate calculations, like the feature table file (features & manual scores), the partitioned training and test sets, as well as the trained classifiers.
