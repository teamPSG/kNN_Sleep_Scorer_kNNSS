# Contributing

Thank you for helping to make this package better!

If you use our code and run into a bug or any problem, please open an issue here. Any questions, comments or suggestions can be sent via GitHub or send an e-mail to Tam√°s Kiss at kiss.t (at) wigner.hu.

Contributions to the code are very welcome. Since this repository follows the standard open source protocol, please use the basic [GitHub workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to suggest a modification or addition. TL;DR: fork this repository and clone it to your own machine. Then make your changes, push your work back up to the fork on GitHub and open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) so that we can review your changes and discuss them with you before accepting and merging them to the main project.

Please restrict your commit to one modification per commit and ideally form a legible commit history. In your pull request, please describe clearly and concisely your motivation and the feature you developed.

Also, please try to keep your code easily readable and tidy using [smart indenting](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/improve-code-readability.html). We feel that writing help to functions greatly improves understanding of the code and its function so please follow the MATLAB basic structure for `help` text: [Add Help for Your Program](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/add-help-for-your-program.html).
