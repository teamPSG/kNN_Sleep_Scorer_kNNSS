# *k*-Nearest Neighbors Classifier-Based Sleep Staging (*k*NNSS)

## Welcome to *k*NNSS software

*k*NNSS is a Matlab package for automated sleep stage scoring using the *k*-nearest neighbors algorithm. Compared to other automated sleep scoring packages its main advantage is simplicity and the use of physiologically relevant, human-interpretable features.

## Using *k*NNSS
### Compatibility and dependencies
*k*NNSS was tested in Matlab R2014b and R2018a. The software uses the Signal Processing Toolbox and the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox from Matlab. Also, some functions from the [Chronux Toolbox](http://chronux.org)  are used to calculate spectral properties of data (see below for a list of files). European Data Format (EDF; https://www.edfplus.info/) files are read using Brett Shoelson's (brett.shoelson@mathworks.com) edfread() function. Hjorth parameters are calculated by hjorth() a function written by Alois Schloegl (a.schloegl@ieee.org) as part of the [BIOSIG-toolbox](http://biosig.sf.net). This GitHub project is self-containing, no further downloads are required.

#### Chronux Toolbox file list
change_row_to_column.m, dpsschk.m, getfgrid.m, getparams.m, mtfftc.m, mtspecgramc.m, mtspectrumc.m

### Folder content

- Example_Data: this directory contains three subdirectories. IntermRes is initially empty, intermediat files generated during the execution of the test scripts will be stored here. RawData contains epolysomnographycal recordings from Thomas Kilduff's laboratory at SRI International in EDF format. Subfolder EDF contain raw recordings, subfolder FFT stores associated manual sleep scores used to train classifiers and test prediction efficacy.

- Function_Library: this directory stores all the necessary Matlab functions required by *k*NNSS. Functions inputs and outputs are described in detail in the function header. Use Matlab's help to read about details of each function. A list of high-level purpose of functions is found in the Readme in this folder.

- Software_Verification: a set of scripts to test the code on your system are in this folder. For a detailed description see the Readme in this folder.

- JOSS_Paper: contains the manuscript submitted to the Journal of Open Source Software. The journal paper will provide background to the software, a summary of our work, applications and references.

### Installation
All functions are stored in the Function_Library folder. Simply adding this folder to Matlab's function path will take care of installation. Alternatively, check out contents of the Software_Verification folder.
